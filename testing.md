## Client stories testing

The following section goes through each of the user strories from the UX section of [README.md](README.md)

As a player, I want:

As a player between 5-10 years old, I want:

1. A simple easy to understand interface.
    -Simple design and all controls and game are on one page.
2. Simple buttons and mechanisms.
    -Colourful images used as buttons to play the game.
3. Audio and visual feedback so that I know I am progressing through the game.
    -Sound is produced and image animates each time a sequence is made, score increases with each succesful round.
4. Colourful and fun characters.
    -Colourful cartoon images used as buttons
5. Ability to see my high score so that I can try to beat it.
    -High score visible and centered below images.

As an adult I want: 

1. A simple and easy to understand interface.
    -Simple design and all controls and game are on one page.
2. A challenging game to test my memory.
    -Game gets more difficult with each round as an item is added to the sequence to remember.
3. Appealing aesthetic.
    -Simple and effective with bold colours
4. Score count to see how well I am doing.
    -Score always visible beneath the images which increases with each round
5. High score count so I can challenge myself to beat it.
    -High score visible and remains after end of game.

## Manual testing
Below is an account of manual testing done.

### Testing undertaken on desktop
All steps on desktop were repeated in browsers: Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer and on two different desktop screen sizes.

1. Main page
    1. How to play button
        - Clicked button and alert with information clearly displayed
    2. Start button
        - Clicked button and first sequence was heard and visualised
        - After Game Over clicked button restarted the game with new randomised sequences.
    3. Scores
        -Score number increased by 1 after each succesful round
        -High score shown for highest score achieved.
    4. Images
       -Images worked like buttons and translated user options into sequences
       -Image displayed visual animation with each sequence.

### Testing undertaken on tablet and phone devices

All steps below repeated to test functionality on developers Iphone and Ipad and in Chrome Developers Tools device simulators on all options and orientations.

1. Main page
    1. How to play button
        - Clicked button and alert with information clearly displayed
    2. Start button
        - Clicked button and first sequence was heard and visualised.
        - After Game Over clicked button restarted the game with new randomised sequences. Occasionally audio was not played at start of game.
    3. Scores
        -Score number increased by 1 after each succesful round
        -High score shown for highest score achieved.
    4. Images
       -Images worked like buttons and translated user options into sequences
       -Image displayed visual animation with each sequence.
    5. Positioning
        -Elements remained in position even on small screen size
2. Issues
    1. Audio
        1. Audio would not play in some instances during a sequence, an issue with phone browsers.

### Bugs discovered:
#### Solved bugs

1. Event listener in function caused multiplying entries into array.

- When attaching event listener to images, I initially did so in a function that was being called back to regularly resulting in playerSequence array containing exponential amounts of strings with each round.
    - Fix: Removed from that particular function, broke the Javascript into smaller more managable functions.

2. Incorrect equality tests causing the game to end prematurely.

- Initially I was testing to see if the randomly generated sequence was the same length as the player generated sequence. As it was not the game would end.
    -Fix: Created another test before testing length to see if the last item in the array of the sequence was equal to the array the player generated sequence. This would then direct back to the newSequence function before testing if both string.length were equal.


#### Unsolved bugs

1. Audio bugs in Safari browser
    -Safari browser not capable of playing multiple audio files in succesion.
    -cannot find solution.

## Further testing:
1. Asked fellow students, friends and family to look at the site on their devices and report any issues they found.

2. Memory Farm viewed on all devices and orientations available in Chrome DevTools.
