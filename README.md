# [Memory Farm](https://github.com/shaun-davies/memory-farm-game)

Memory Farm is a basic Simon-inspired game with an agricultural twist. Simple and easy to use, the game appeals to a younger audience of 5-10 years old and to adults looking to improve their retentative skills.


## UX
 
  The aim of the website is to:

1. Be a fun game that appeals to all ages.
2. To test memory and induce competitiveness to beat high score.
3. To improve memory, enhance recall and increase retention of information.  

### User stories

As a player between 5-10 years old, I want:

1. A simple easy to understand interface.
2. Simple buttons and mechanisms.
3. Audio and visual feedback so that I know I am progressing through the game.
4. Colourful and fun characters.
5. Ability to see my high score so that I can try to beat it.

As an adult I want: 

1. A simple and easy to understand interface.
2. A challenging game to test my memory.
3. Appealing aesthetic.
4. Score count to see how well I am doing.
5. High score count so I can challenge myself to beat it.

### Design Choices

The aesthetic of the game is designed for children to enjoy. The following design choices were made with this in mind:

**Font**

- The only font chosen was Fredoka. It is a simple and easy to understand font with a child-like quality to it.

**Colours**

- Most of the page features no colour apart from the images. Adding vibrancy and contrast to the clickable images to make them pop.

**Images**

- Colourful cartoon images of farm animals were chosen as the clickable icons to appeal to young children of any gender.

**Audio files**

- When a new sequence is created and when clicked the farm animals produce a sound that is unique to them.

- Children can learn what sound a chicken, cow, pig or sheep make.

- Comical and musical aspect of randomly generated animal sounds engage the user.

### Wireframes

These wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) during the Scope Plane part of the design and planning process for this project.
